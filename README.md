## Streamlit to Next.js Migration Path

### STEP 1: Set Up Project Structure
- [x] Complete Step 1

Create a clean, organized project structure that separates concerns and makes future migration easier.

- [x] **1.1:** Create three main files: `app.py`, `document_service.py`, and `models.py`
  - [`backend/models.py`](./backend/models.py): Defines data structures used throughout the application. Contains classes for document variables, request/response formats. Acts as a single source of truth for data types, making it easier to maintain type consistency and validation.
  - [`backend/document_service.py`](./backend/document_service.py): Core business logic layer (service layer). Handles document generation functionality independent of the UI. Contains pure functions for document processing. Will become your API later when you migrate to Next.js. Includes template loading, document rendering, and file operations.
  - [`frontend/app.py`](./frontend/app.py): Entry point for your Streamlit application. Manages the user interface and interactions. Contains form components, file upload handling. Uses the document_service.py functions to generate documents. Keeps UI logic separate from business logic for easier migration later.
- [x] **1.2:** Organize templates in `/templates/files/` directory
- [x] **1.3:** Create `/outputs/` directory for generated files

### STEP 2: Create Service Layer (Future API)
- [x] Complete Step 2

Isolate all business logic into a service layer that will later become your API backend. This is the most critical step for a smooth migration.

- [x] **2.1:** Move all document generation logic to `document_service.py`
- [x] **2.2:** Create pure functions with clear inputs/outputs
- [x] **2.3:** Avoid any Streamlit dependencies in this file

### STEP 3: Define Data Models
- [x] Complete Step 3

Create clear data models that define the structure of your application's data, making it easier to validate and transform data later.

- [x] **3.1:** Create type definitions in `models.py`
- [x] **3.2:** Define input/output schemas for variables
- [x] **3.3:** Keep validation logic separate from UI code

### STEP 4: Build Streamlit UI
- [x] Complete Step 4

Build your Streamlit interface that interacts with the service layer but doesn't contain business logic itself.

- [x] **4.1:** Create form components in `app.py`
- [x] **4.2:** Call service layer functions for document generation
- [x] **4.3:** Handle uploads, downloads, and error states

### STEP 5: Test & Deploy
- [ ] Complete Step 5

Test your application locally and deploy it to a hosting service for public access.

- [ ] **5.1:** Test locally with `streamlit run app.py`
- [ ] **5.2:** Deploy to Streamlit Cloud or other hosting

### Future Migration Steps (When Ready for Next.js)
- [ ] Complete Step 6

When you're ready to scale or need more advanced features, follow these steps to migrate to a Next.js + API architecture.

- [ ] **6.1:** Create FastAPI wrapper around `document_service.py`
- [ ] **6.2:** Build Next.js UI that calls your API endpoints
- [ ] **6.3:** Keep both applications running during transition
- [ ] **6.4:** Add authentication and other advanced features

This numbered approach gives you clear reference points for each implementation task.

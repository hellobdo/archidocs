# Implementation Strategy

## Streamlit to Next.js Migration Path

### STEP 1: Set Up Project Structure
- [ ] Complete Step 1

Create a clean, organized project structure that separates concerns and makes future migration easier.

- [ ] **1.1:** Create three main files: `app.py`, `document_service.py`, and `models.py`
- [ ] **1.2:** Organize templates in `/templates/files/` directory
- [ ] **1.3:** Create `/outputs/` directory for generated files

### STEP 2: Create Service Layer (Future API)
- [ ] Complete Step 2

Isolate all business logic into a service layer that will later become your API backend. This is the most critical step for a smooth migration.

- [ ] **2.1:** Move all document generation logic to `document_service.py`
- [ ] **2.2:** Create pure functions with clear inputs/outputs
- [ ] **2.3:** Avoid any Streamlit dependencies in this file

### STEP 3: Define Data Models
- [ ] Complete Step 3

Create clear data models that define the structure of your application's data, making it easier to validate and transform data later.

- [ ] **3.1:** Create type definitions in `models.py`
- [ ] **3.2:** Define input/output schemas for variables
- [ ] **3.3:** Keep validation logic separate from UI code

### STEP 4: Build Streamlit UI
- [ ] Complete Step 4

Build your Streamlit interface that interacts with the service layer but doesn't contain business logic itself.

- [ ] **4.1:** Create form components in `app.py`
- [ ] **4.2:** Call service layer functions for document generation
- [ ] **4.3:** Handle uploads, downloads, and error states

### STEP 5: Test & Deploy
- [ ] Complete Step 5

Test your application locally and deploy it to a hosting service for public access.

- [ ] **5.1:** Test locally with `streamlit run app.py`
- [ ] **5.2:** Deploy to Streamlit Cloud or other hosting

### Future Migration Steps (When Ready for Next.js)
- [ ] Complete Step 6

When you're ready to scale or need more advanced features, follow these steps to migrate to a Next.js + API architecture.

- [ ] **6.1:** Create FastAPI wrapper around `document_service.py`
- [ ] **6.2:** Build Next.js UI that calls your API endpoints
- [ ] **6.3:** Keep both applications running during transition
- [ ] **6.4:** Add authentication and other advanced features

This numbered approach gives you clear reference points for each implementation task.
